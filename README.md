### Typography
There was no special typography used in this project. I have only used in-built p, h1 & h2 typography to keep the website simple.

### Imagery
All the imagees used in the project is related to the cities related to the blog. Only 4 images are static which are in carousel section and about section. The remaining images will be uploaded by the author to the database.
