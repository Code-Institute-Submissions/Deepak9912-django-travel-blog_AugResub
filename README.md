# Django-Travel-Blog

Project milestone 4 for Code Institute Full-stack development program with Django framework:

A travel blog website, where a user can post their travel related blogs. When the user posts their blogs, it will be displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.

The site is fully responsive and was built using the Django framework in Python.

## Agile Methodology
All functionality and development of this project were managed using GitHub which Projects can be found [here](https://github.com/Deepak9912).

### The Scope

Main Site goals:
1. To provide users with a good experience when using the travel blog website.
2. To provide users with a website that is easy to navigate.
3. To provide a website with a clear purpose.
4. To provide role-based permissions that allows user to interact with the website.

### Design
The color scheme chosen for this project is mainly black and white using bootstrap colors. The text color on the navbar and footer is text-light, text-muted and text-wraning using bootstrap against a black background. The carousel section has white bold text color against a faded background image. 

![color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93731898/179424976-df48c8b6-63a0-425d-a2bb-c95a3ddf7cbf.PNG)

### Typography
There was no special typography used in this project. I have only used in-built p, h1 & h2 typography to keep the website simple.

### Imagery
All the imagees used in the project is related to the cities related to the blog. Only 4 images are static which are in carousel section and about section. The remaining images will be uploaded by the author to the database.


## Features

### Navbar

### Admin Panel/ Superuser

## Creating the Django app

1. Go to the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template Template
2. Click on Use This Template
3. Once the template is available in your repository click on Gitpod
4. When the image for the template and the Gitpod are ready open a new terminal to start a new Django App
5. Install Django and gunicorn: pip3 install django gunicorn
6. Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
7. Create file for requirements: in the terminal window type pip freeze --local > requirements.txt
8. Create project: in the terminal window type django-admin startproject your_project_name
9. Create app: in the terminal window type python3 manage.py startapp your_app_name
10. Add app to the list of installed apps in settings.py file: you_app_name
11. Migrate changes: in the terminal window type python3 manage.py migrate
12. Run the server to test if the app is installed, in the terminal window type python3 manage.py runserver
13. If the app has been installed correctly the window will display The install worked successfully! Congratulations!

7. Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with SECRET_KEY
8. Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the CLOUDINARY_URL
9. Click Reveal Config Vars and add a new record with the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
10. The next page is the projectâ€™s Deploy Tab. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars
11. Next, scroll down to the Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select python and click Save Changes
12. Scroll to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab
13. Select Github as the deployment method

15. Search for the repository name and click the connect button
16. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
17. Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github


## Final Deployment

1. Create a runtime.txt python-3.8.13
2. Create a Procfile web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi
3. When development is complete change the debug setting to: DEBUG = False in settings.py
4. In this project the summernote editor was used so for this to work in Heroku add: X_FRAME_OPTIONS = SAMEORIGIN to settings.py.
5. In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
